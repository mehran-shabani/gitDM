IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS - DJANGO SETTINGS (DO NOT MODIFY)

The Django settings in this project have been finalized with critical security improvements. When working on this codebase:

1. DO NOT MODIFY these files:
   - config/settings.py (security patches applied)
   - config/test_settings.py 
   - pytest.ini (configured for test database)
   - .env.example

2. DO NOT COMMIT any settings changes, even temporary ones

3. CURRENT STATE:
   - SECRET_KEY: Secured with production safeguards
   - ALLOWED_HOSTS: Properly restricted
   - Database: Uses environment variables
   - Tests: Configured to use SQLite test database

4. FOR LOCAL SETUP:
   - Copy .env.example to .env
   - Follow doc/local-development-without-containers.md
   - Use environment variables for all configuration

5. IF YOU NEED DIFFERENT SETTINGS:
   - Create config/local_settings.py (never commit)
   - Document needs but don't implement changes

The settings have been professionally secured and audited. They must remain unchanged to maintain security integrity.
